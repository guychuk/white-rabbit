# White Rabbit 🐇
## ℹ️ What Is This Project About?
I just wrapped up my second year of studies and suddenly have some free time. 
I'm planing to mess around with some ideas I picked up this year and maybe even learn some new things.  
**Why the name?** ChatGPT suggested it as a two-word "catchphrase" from a children's tale (which of course, it is not) and I had no better name in mind. 
It is also a great song! [#🛩️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnJM_jC7j_4)
## 🔎 What Will You Find Here?
So far, I've got  
- 🤖 _automata-simulator_: **DFA** (Deterministic Finite Automata) and **NFA** (Nondeterministic Finite Automata) **Simulator** - ability to create and check if words are accepted (programmatically), a page where you can *draw a DFA or an NFA* or *generate a random one*, and also ***run simulations***!
- 🔢 _matrix-calculator_: a **Matrix Calculator** - can perform matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. You can also calculate a matrix' inverse, transpose, conjugate transpose, ... and check what type of matrix is it (hermitian? symmetric? diagonal?). <br> _**I am planning to** implement diagonalization and SVD and a linear system solver._
